# prework-study-guide
A study guide for pre-work

## Description

- This project is a prerequisite for a MSU Bootcamp Coarse. 
- Built in order to learn the basic concepts of coding for web development.
- I learned so much being new to the tech world. 
- It was basicly a intro to HTML CSS and Javascript.
- I learned how to think like a developer, use GitHub, solve real world problems
- build a simple website with GitBash and VSCode.
- Steps that got me there were installing GitBash and VSCode to work hand in hand to make 
- the website visiable. After instalation of VSCode I learned about HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
